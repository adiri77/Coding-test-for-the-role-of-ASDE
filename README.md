### Algorithm Walkthrough:

1. **Define Enemy Powers and Regeneration Effects**:
   - `p`: This array contains powers of enemies from circles 1 to 11 and additional entries for half the powers of enemies from circles 3 and 7 due to their regeneration ability, i.e., `p = [k1, k2, k3, ..., k11, k3/2, k7/2]`.

2. **Sort Initial Enemy Powers in Descending Order**:
   - `x`: This array sorts the initial powers of enemies from the highest to the lowest, not considering the regenerative powers. Thus, `x = sorted([k1, k2, k3, ..., k11], descending)`.

3. **Select Top Enemies to Potentially Skip**:
   - `r`: This array takes the first `a` highest powers from `x`, representing the enemies Abhimanyu could skip, i.e., `r = x[:a]`.

4. **Calculate Required and Available Powers**:
   - `q`: Total required power, the sum of `p`, i.e., `q = sum(p)`.
   - `s`: Sum of the powers of enemies that Abhimanyu considers skipping, i.e., `s = sum(r)`.
   - `z`: Abhimanyu's effective fighting power considering his ability to recharge `b` times, i.e., `z = initial_power * b`.

5. **Decision Logic to Determine Escape Feasibility**:
   - **Case 1**: If `z` (power after recharge) is greater than `q` (total required power), then Abhimanyu can escape (`return True`).
   - **Case 2.1**: If neither the third nor the seventh enemies are in `r`:
     - If `z > q - s`, then Abhimanyu can escape (`return True`).
   - **Case 2.2**: If either the third or the seventh enemies or both are among the skipped (`r`):
     - **Case 2.2.1**: If `k3` is in `r`:
       - If `z > q - (s - k3/2)`, then Abhimanyu can escape (`return True`).
     - **Case 2.2.2**: If `k7` is in `r`:
       - If `z > q - (s - k7/2)`, then Abhimanyu can escape (`return True`).
     - **Case 2.2.3**: If both `k3` and `k7` are in `r`:
       - If `z > q - (s - k7/2 - k3/2)`, then Abhimanyu can escape (`return True`).

6. **Special Considerations**:
   - **All Powers Skipped**: If the number of skips `a` is greater than or equal to the total number of circles (11), Abhimanyu wouldn't need to fight any battles. This results in an automatic victory.
   - **Minimal Initial Power**: If Abhimanyuâ€™s initial power is zero or very low, and the recharge `b` isn't sufficient to boost his power to meet or exceed the lowest enemy power, he will definitely lose unless he skips those battles.
   - **Excessive Recharge Factor**: When the recharge multiplier `b` is very high, ensure the calculation does not result in an integer overflow. Utilize larger data types or limit checks to prevent computational errors in environments with limited integer ranges.

### Execution:
To execute this algorithm, provide the setup of enemy powers, Abhimanyu's starting power, his recharge boon `b`, and his skip ability `a`. The results will depend on these inputs, determining whether or not Abhimanyu can make it through the Chakravyuh successfully.
